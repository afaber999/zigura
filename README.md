# ZIGura

**ZIGura** is a high-performance 3D rendering engine built using the **ZIG** programming language. Inspired by the architectural strength of ancient ziggurats, ZIGura provides a solid, layered foundation for rendering complex scenes with precision, speed, and flexibility. This project is designed to empower developers, designers, and artists in creating stunning 3D graphics, with an emphasis on modularity, efficiency, and modern rendering techniques.

## Inspiration

The foundation of ZIGura is heavily inspired by the **Software 3D Rendering** series on YouTube by **bennybox**. This fantastic series breaks down the fundamentals of 3D rendering and has served as an invaluable resource in understanding and implementing the core concepts of software-based rendering. Through Benny's tutorials, I've adopted and expanded on key rendering techniques and adapted them using the **ZIG** programming. I highly recommend checking out Benny's channel for anyone interested in the underlying principles of 3D graphics!


## Key Features

- **Simple easy and self contained**: Leveraging ZIGâ€™s performance advantages, ZIGura delivers a powerful, fast, and memory-safe softwarerendering experience.
- **Layered Scene Composition**: Build complex scenes with ease, utilizing ZIGura's modular architecture to manage geometry, lighting, textures, and materials.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Run ZIGura on various platforms with optimized rendering paths for each, making it flexible for different environments, includeing WASM.

## Getting Started

To begin with ZIGura, ensure you have the ZIG compiler installed. Then, follow these steps to install and run a sample render:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ZIGura.git
   cd ZIGura


Happy hacking
